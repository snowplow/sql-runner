# SQL Runner

[ ![Build Status] [travis-image] ] [travis] [ ![Release] [release-image] ] [releases] [ ![License] [license-image] ] [license]

## Overview

Run playbooks of SQL scripts in series and parallel on Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL.

Used with **[Snowplow] [snowplow]** for scheduled SQL-based transformations of event stream data.

## User Quickstart

Assuming you are running on **64bit Linux**:

```bash
> wget http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/sql_runner_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip
> unzip sql_runner_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip
> ./sql-runner -usage
```

See the **User Guide** section below for more.

## Developer Quickstart

### Building

Assuming git, **[Vagrant] [vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow/sql-runner
 host> cd sql-runner
 host> vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest> cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/snowplow/sql-runner
guest> godep go build
```

### Testing

Assuming **Building** complete:

```
guest> sudo -u postgres psql
psql# \password
psql# Enter password: postgres
psql# \q
guest> psql -c 'create database sql_runner_tests_1' -U postgres
guest> psql -c 'create database sql_runner_tests_2' -U postgres
guest> ./sql-runner -playbook ./integration-tests/good-postgres.yml -var test_date=`date "+%Y_%m_%d"`
```

### Publishing

Assuming **[Travis] [travis]** is green and versions updated:

```bash
 host> vagrant push
```

This will build an individual artifact for Windows, OSX and Linux all in 64 bit.  All artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.

## User guide

### CLI Arguments

There are several command line arguments that can be used:

* `-playbook` : This is a required argument and should point to the playbook you wish to run.
* `-fromStep` : Optional argument which will allow you to start the sql-runner from any step in your playbook.
* `-sqlroot`  : Optional argument to change where we look for the sql statements to run, defaults to the directory of your playbook.
* `-var`      : Optional argument which allows you to pass a dictionary of key-value pairs which will be used to flesh out your templates.
* `-consul`   : Optional argument which allows you to fetch playbooks and SQL files from a Consul server.

### Playbooks

A playbook consists of one of more _steps_, each of which consists of one or more _queries_. Steps are run in series, queries are run in parallel within the step. 

Each query contains the path to a _query file_. See **Query files** for details

All steps are applied against all _targets_. All targets are processed in parallel.

For the playbook template see: [config/config.yml.sample] [example-config]

### Query files

A query file contains one or more SQL statements. These are executed "raw" (i.e. not in a transaction) in series by SQL Runner. 

If the query file is flagged as a _template_ in the playbook, then the file is pre-processed as a template before being executed. See **Templates** for details

### Templates

Templates are run through Golang's [text template processor] [go-text-template]. The template processor can access all _variables_ defined in the playbook.

The following custom functions are also supported:

* `nowWithFormat [timeFormat]`: where `timeFormat` is a valid Golang [time format] [go-time-format]
* `awsEnvCredentials`: supports passing credentials through environment variables, such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `awsProfileCredentials`: supports getting credentials from a credentials file, also used by boto/awscli
* `awsEC2RoleCredentials`: supports getting role-based credentials, i.e. getting the automatically generated credentials in EC2 instances
* `awsChainCredentials`: tries to get credentials from each of the three methods above in order, using the first one returned

**Note**: All AWS functions output strings in the Redshift credentials format (`CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=%s;aws_secret_access_key=%s'`).

For an example query file using templating see: [integration-tests/postgres-sql/good/3.sql] [example-query]

### Failure modes

If a statement fails in a query file, the query will terminate and report failure.

If a query fails, its sibling queries will continue running, but no further steps will run.

Failures in one target do not affect other targets in any way.
