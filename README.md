## Overview

Run playbooks of SQL scripts in series and parallel on Snowflake DB, Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL.

Used with **[Snowplow][snowplow]** for scheduled SQL-based transformations of event stream data.

## Quick start

Assuming [go][go-url], [docker][docker-url] and [docker-compose][docker-compose-url] are installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow/sql-runner
 host> cd sql-runner
 host> make setup-up    # Launches Consul + Postgres for testing
 host> make             # Builds sql-runner binaries
 host> make test        # Runs unit tests

 # DISTRO specifies which binary you want to run integration tests with
 host> DISTRO=darwin make integration
```

_Note_: You will need to ensure that `~/go/bin` is on your PATH for `gox` to work - the underlying tool that we use for building the binaries.

When you are done with testing simply execute `make setup-down` to terminate the docker-compose stack.

To reset the testing resources execute `make setup-reset` which will rebuild the docker containers.  This can be useful if the state of these systems gets out of sync with what the tests expect.

To remove all build files:

```bash
guest> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
guest> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `make format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

## How to use?

First either compile the binary from source using the above `make` command or download the published Binary directly from Bintray:

* [Darwin (macOS)](https://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/sql_runner_0.8.0_darwin_amd64.zip)
* [Linux](https://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/sql_runner_0.8.0_linux_amd64.zip)
* [Windows](https://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/sql_runner_0.8.0_windows_amd64.zip)

### CLI Output

```bash
sql-runner version: 0.8.0
Run playbooks of SQL scripts in series and parallel on Redshift and Postgres
Usage:
  -checkLock string
    	Checks whether the lockfile already exists
  -consul string
    	The address of a consul server with playbooks and SQL files stored in KV pairs
  -consulOnlyForLock
    	Will read playbooks locally, but use Consul for locking.
  -deleteLock string
    	Will attempt to delete a lockfile if it exists
  -dryRun
    	Runs through a playbook without executing any of the SQL
  -fillTemplates
    	Will print all queries after templates are filled
  -fromStep string
    	Starts from a given step defined in your playbook
  -help
    	Shows this message
  -lock string
    	Optional argument which checks and sets a lockfile to ensure this run is a singleton. Deletes lock on run completing successfully
  -playbook string
    	Playbook of SQL scripts to execute
  -runQuery string
    	Will run a single query in the playbook
  -showQueryOutput
    	Will print all output from queries
  -softLock string
    	Optional argument, like '-lock' but the lockfile will be deleted even if the run fails
  -sqlroot string
    	Absolute path to SQL scripts. Use PLAYBOOK, BINARY and PLAYBOOK_CHILD for those respective paths (default "PLAYBOOK")
  -var value
    	Variables to be passed to the playbook, in the key=value format
  -version
    	Shows the program version
```
